# rPPG GUI App

A real-time Python application for extracting remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from webcam input. It features signal plotting, FFT analysis, and face detection â€” all integrated into a PyQt5 GUI.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Real-time webcam capture
- Face detection using OpenCV Haar cascades
- Show when the face is detected
- Green channel extraction for rPPG

## TODO

[ ] adding other methods such as CHROM and POS
[ ] Maybe adding TS-CAN ?
[ ] Functionality to select the method before processing begins
[ ] Option to select the face detection algorithm
[ ] Update the costly transfer of images between threads and only send the cropped image
